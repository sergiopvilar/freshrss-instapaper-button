# FreshRSS Instapaper Button

A [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/) extension which adds a better [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) sharing integration.

The existing Instapaper sharing functionality of FreshRSS always opens a new tab which you have to manually close after sharing. You also have to stay logged in into Instapaper.

With this extension you can simply press the Instapaper Button next to an article or a custom keyboard shortcut to share it with Instapaper. Everything else happens in the background while you can continue reading articles without any further interruptions.
